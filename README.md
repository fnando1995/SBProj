# Pico y Placa, License Plate number predictor for traffic in peak hours



### Description:
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, weâ€™d like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer. 

### Peak hour rules:

Within a specified city, you can not drive (car or motorcicle) during the peak hours (07:00 - 09:30 and 16:00 - 19:30) if your
vehicule's last digit is blacklisted for the day.


| Day               | Black Digits |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Monday            | 1 - 2        |
| Tuesday           | 3 - 4        |
| Wednesday         | 5 - 6        |
| Thursday          | 7 - 8        |
| Friday            | 9 - 0        |
| Saturday & Sunday | None         |
